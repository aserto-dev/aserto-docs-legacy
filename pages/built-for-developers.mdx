# Built for developers

### Opinionated framework 

Aserto provides an opinionated authorization framework that covers 80% of what it takes to build RBAC.

### Contract-first APIs

Aserto provides REST/gRPC APIs 

### Language SDKs

Aserto has language and framework bindings for React.js, node.js, and express.js.

### Deployment model

Aserto provides a flexible deployment model - a hosted service, a local service, or a sidecar.

### Open source

At the core of Aserto is an open source authorizer, based on the CNCF OPA project.

Here is some code

```js
const x = 'Aserto'
console.log('hello ' + x)
```

You can use live react code to display react component with a preview

<Playground>
    <div style={{ width: 100, height: 100, background: 'lightblue' }}>
        hello everyone
    </div>
</Playground>
