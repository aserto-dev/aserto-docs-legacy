# Introduction

Along with the Aserto CLI and the API, the Aserto Console is one of the primary ways 
that developers interact with the Aserto control plane.

The Aserto Console has two main functions:
* Manage artifacts (connections, policies, directory) 
* Interact with the hosted Authorizer

All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [tenant](/overview/tenant). 

## Switching tenants

The currently selected tenant is displayed in the left portion of the navbar of the console. To 
switch tenants (assuming you have access to more than one tenant), select the tenant you'd like to 
manage from the dropdown.

## Managing a tenant

As a tenant owner, you can manage a tenant's members by selecting the "Manage" menu item from the 
tenant dropdown.
