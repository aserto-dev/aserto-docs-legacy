# Managing Policies

The underpinning of Aserto's authorization model is a [policy](/overview/policy). 

Policies are authored, stored, and versioned as code in a `git` repository.

> Currently, GitHub is the only supported source for policy repositories. More to come!

## Add a policy

When you click on “Add a policy”, you'll go through a short workflow to select a git repository for your policy, 
and name that policy in the Aserto console. 

The first step is to select a connection to a source code control system. If you don't have any yet, follow 
the instructions to [create one](/aserto-console/connections#connecting-a-source-code-provider).

In the next step, you'll be asked to select an organization & repo. Unless 
you already have a GitHub repository with the right GitHub Actions for building and pushing a policy image, 
select the “New (using template)” radio button, and select one of the templates.

Name your new repository with the prefix `policy-` (for example, `policy-peoplefinder`). This will 
clone the template to the organization and repository name that you selected. The repository will 
have the right GitHub Action installed, so that when you tag a commit, a new policy image will 
automatically be built and pushed to the Aserto Registry. See the [Policy Lifecycle](/overview/policy-lifecycle)
topic for more information.

Finally, name your policy with a descriptive name (e.g. peoplefinder).

## Remove a policy

Simply click the `x` in the top right corner of the policy to remove it. Note that removing a policy 
from your Aserto tenant doesn't remove the policy repository. To remove the repository from your git 
provider, use that provider's API or UI.
