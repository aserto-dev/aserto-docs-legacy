# Managing Policies

The underpinning of Aserto's authorization model is a [policy](/overview/policy). 

Policies are authored, stored, and versioned as code in a `git` repository.

> Currently, GitHub is the only supported source for policy repositories. More to come!

## Add a policy 

![Add a policy](/add-a-policy.png)

When you click on “Add a policy”, select “GitHub” as your source code provider. If you're not connected 
to GitHub yet, click the “Sign in & connect” button and complete GitHub's OAuth2 consent flow.

In the next step, you'll be asked to select an organization & repo. Unless 
you already have a GitHub repository with the right GitHub Actions for building and pushing a policy image, 
select the “New (using template)” radio button, and select one of the templates.

Name your new repository with the prefix `policy-` (for example, `policy-peoplefinder`). This will 
clone the template to the organization and repository name that you selected. The repository will 
have the right GitHub Action installed, so that when you tag a commit, a new policy image will 
automatically be built and pushed to the Aserto Registry. See the [Policy Lifecycle](/overview/policy-lifecycle)
topic for more information.

Finally, name your policy with a descriptive name (e.g. peoplefinder).

## Remove a policy

Simply click the `x` in the top right corner of the policy to remove it. Note that removing a policy 
from your Aserto tenant doesn't remove the policy repository. To remove the repository from your git 
provider, use that provider's API or UI.
