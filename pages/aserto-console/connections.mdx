# Managing Connections

The Aserto Control Plane manages [connections](/overview/connections) to external systems that are 
the source of Aserto artifacts.

## Connection types

The Console currently supports two connection types - Identity Providers and Source Code Control systems.

## Connecting an Identity Provider

Aserto needs to connect to one or more identity providers as the source of user attributes and roles. 

> Currently Aserto supports Auth0 as an identity provider. More are on the way!

Click on the “Connections” Navbar tab to see your connections.

Click on the “Connect” button for the identity provider. You will be prompted to enter connection parameters:

![connect auth0](/connect-auth0.png)

Copy the Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret from the Auth0 UI into the Aserto UI.

> Note: the Auth0 application must be a machine-to-machine (M2M) application.

> For more detailed instructions, refer to the [Connect IDP](/getting-started/connect-idp) topic in the 
Getting Started documentation.

When you click the Connect button, Aserto will start streaming your Auth0 tenant users into 
the Aserto directory.

## Connecting a Source Code provider

> Currently Aserto supports GitHub as a source code provider. More are on the way!

Click on the "Sign in and connect" button for your source code provider. You'll go through 
an OAuth2 consent flow. Once you've completed the flow, your source code provider should show 
as connected.

## Disconnecting

Simply click the "Disconnect" button to disconnect an existing connection.
