# Interact with the Aserto Directory

Here are some commands that can get you started interacting with the Aserto directory.
For a full listing, type `aserto directory`, or `aserto d` for short.

```bash
aserto d list-users          # list users in the directory
aserto d get-identity <key>  # get the GUID associated with a user's identity key (e.g. email)
aserto d get-user <key>      # get the full user object based on a GUID or a key
```

## Loading users

You can load users into the Aserto directory either from an identity provider or from a file.

### Identity Provider

To load users from an existing IDP connection, use the following command:

```bash
aserto d load-users --provider=auth0
```

### Side-loading

To "side-load" users from a JSON file in our canonical user format, use this command:

```bash
aserto d load-users --provider=json file=peoplefinder.json
```

An example json file for the peoplefinder users can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aserto-dev/aserto-cli/main/assets/peoplefinder.json).
