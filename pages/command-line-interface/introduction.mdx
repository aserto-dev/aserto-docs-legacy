# The Aserto CLI

Along with the Aserto Console and the API, the `aserto` CLI is one of the primary ways 
that developers interact with Aserto.

The CLI has three main functions:
* Manage artifacts (policies, directory, connections) 
* Interact with an Authorizer
* Manage the local developer experience (OneBox)

All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto *tenant*.
