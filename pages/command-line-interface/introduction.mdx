# The Aserto CLI

Along with the Aserto Console and the API, the `aserto` CLI is one of the primary ways 
that developers interact with Aserto.

The CLI has three main functions:
* Manage [tenant](/overview/tenant) artifacts (policies, directory, connections) 
* Interact with an [Authorizer](/overview/authorizer)
* Manage the local developer experience [OneBox](/command-line-interface/onebox)

All management operations are done in the context of an Aserto [*tenant*](/overview/tenant).
