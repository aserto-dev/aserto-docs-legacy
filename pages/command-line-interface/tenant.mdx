# Aserto Tenants

The tenant is the organizing structure for the artifacts that are managed by Aserto - 
policies, connections, and the user directory. You can think of it like a GitHub organization.

Every tenant has at least one owner. It can also have members (who are allowed to perform 
all operations on a tenant, except inviting other members), and viewers (who are allowed to see 
all tenant information, but not create or edit any tenant artifacts).

## Artifacts

Aserto manages the following artifacts for a tenant:
* Policies - this is a reference to a git repository that stores an authorization policy
* Connections - these are connections to external systems such as source code control systems and identity providers
* User Directory - these are the users that Aserto has synched from one or more connected identity providers

## Role-based access control

Naturally, Aserto uses Aserto for authorization, using a simple role-based access control (RBAC) model.

The roles that Aserto supports:
* Owner: can perform all operations on a tenant, including inviting other viewers, members, and owners, as well as reset the role of another member of the tenant
* Member: can perform all operations on a tenant except inviting others to the tenant or managing tenant membership
* Viewer: can perform only read-only operations on a tenant
