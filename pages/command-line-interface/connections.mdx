# Connections

Aserto manages connections to source code providers and identity providers. 

To list the connections you've established, use the following command:

```bash
aserto tenant list-connections
```

There are two types of connections: system connections and user connections. 

A system connection stores the connection between the tenant and other Aserto services, such as the policy registry and 
the hosted authorizer. 

A user connection is one that the user has established between Aserto and one of their services. There 
are two types of user connections currently supported: 
* IDP (identity provider): this is a read-only connection between Aserto and an Identity Provider. Currently, only Auth0 is supported.
* SCC (source code control): this is a connection between Aserto and a source code control system. Currently, only GitHub is supported.

To display detailed information about a particular connection, type

```bash
aserto tenant get-connection --id <connection-id>
```

To verify that a connection is still operational (i.e. the token that Aserto holds is still valid),
use the following command:

```bash
aserto tenant verify-connection --id <connection-id>
```

To discover the types of connections Aserto supports (known as "Providers"), use the following:

```bash
aserto tenant list-providers
```

To list the kinds of providers Aserto supports, type 

```bash
aserto tenant list-provider-kinds
```

To get more detailed information about a provider, use the following command (using the ID that 
is listed in the `list-providers` results):

```bash
aserto tenant get-provider --id <provider-id>
```
