# Aserto account

In order to use the CLI to manage your Aserto artifacts (policies, directory, connections), you 
need to have an Aserto account. If you don't have one yet, go to the [console](https://console.aserto.com) 
and sign up for an account.

> Note: Aserto is currently in private beta. You need an invitation to create an account. To obtain an invitation, please complete our [sign-up form](https://wwww.aserto.com/sign-up).

## Logging in

```bash
aserto login
```

This command will open a browser window and allow you to authenticate with the Aserto identity provider. 
Once you have, Aserto will store your access token in your keychain, so that the CLI can cache your 
session.

## Account information

```bash
aserto tenant get-account
```

This command returns the [tenants](/overview/tenant) the current account is registered with. It also returns 
the default tenant.
