# Add extended attributes for PeopleFinder users

PeopleFinder expects to operate over users with extended attributes like department, title, manager.  
These extended attributes can come from the identity provider, or can be stored as user extensions 
in the Aserto directory. This second option is more flexible, since it doesn't require an application 
to have write access to a customer's identity provider in order to store properties, roles, or permissions.

The PeopleFinder sample demonstrates this use case. It utilizes three properties that aren't stored 
in the identity provider: **department**, **title**, and **manager**.

We're going to use the Aserto CLI to add these extended attributes to each of the users that Aserto 
imported from the identity provider (Auth0) in the last step.

## Install the Aserto CLI

On a Mac or Linux system:

```bash
brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto
```

> For Windows (or if you want to download it as a zip file), refer to the [CLI installation page](/command-line-interface/installation).

Login to your account:

```bash
aserto login
```

## Verify that the users were successfully imported 

In the previous step, you connected Auth0 as an identity provider. Let's make sure those users
were synchronized into the Aserto directory:

```bash
aserto directory get-user karinl@acmecorp.com
```

You should get a result that looks like this:
```json
{
  "result":  {
    "id":  "011a88bc-7df9-4d92-ba1f-2ff319e101e1",
    "enabled":  false,
    "display_name":  "Karin Lamb",
    "email":  "karinl@acmecorp.com",
    ...
  }
}
```

> Note: if you get an error that looks like the one below, repeat the previous step of connecting the Auth0 tenant.
> `aserto: error: resolve identity: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = key [karinl@acmecorp.com]: key not found` 

> Advanced: you can also [side-load](/command-line-interface/directory#side-loading) users, but we 
> don't recommend it just yet - since you'll need to have your Auth0 tenant in good working order in order to 
> use it as the identity provider for your PeopleFinder instance!

## Add the user extensions 

Download the `peoplefinder.json` file, which contains the user extension data for the 272 users that 
we loaded into Auth0 in the [Set up test users](/getting-started/set-up-users) topic:

> Note: install `wget` if you don't have it yet: `brew install wget`

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aserto-dev/aserto-cli/main/assets/peoplefinder.json
```

Use the Aserto CLI to upload extended attributes for every user we created in Auth0:

```bash
aserto directory load-user-ext --provider=json --file=peoplefinder.json
```

Verify that the users now have extended attributes:

```bash
aserto directory get-user-props karinl@acmecorp.com 
```

You should get back a result that looks like this:

```json
{
  "department": "CRM Strategy",
  "manager": "2cfdb538-a03d-44b1-a0f2-b7ef32b713a7",
  "phone": "+1-20-5555-9834",
  "title": "CRM Consultant"
}
```
