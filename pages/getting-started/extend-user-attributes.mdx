# Add extended attributes for PeopleFinder users

PeopleFinder expects to operate over users with extended attributes like department, title, manager.  
These extended attributes can come from the identity provider, or can be stored as user extensions 
in the Aserto directory. This second option is more flexible, since it doesn't require an application 
to have write access to a customer's identity provider in order to store properties, roles, or permissions.

The PeopleFinder sample demonstrates this use case. It utilizes three properties that aren't stored 
in the identity provider: **department**, **title**, and **manager**.

We're going to use the Aserto CLI to add these extended attributes to each of the users that Aserto 
imported from the identity provider (Auth0) in the last step.

## Install the Aserto CLI

```bash
brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto
```

Login to your account:

```bash
aserto login
```

## Add the user extensions 

Download the `acmecorp.json` file, which contains the user extension data for the 272 users that 
we loaded into Auth0 in the [Set up test users](/getting-started/set-up-users) topic:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aserto-dev/aserto-cli/main/assets/acmecorp.json
```

Use the Aserto CLI to upload extended attributes for every user we created in Auth0:

```bash
aserto dir load-users --provider json --input acmecorp.json
```

Verify that the users now have extended attributes:

```bash
aserto dir get-user-ext --id 011a88bc-7df9-4d92-ba1f-2ff319e101e1 props
```
```json
{
  "department": "CRM Strategy",
  "manager": "2cfdb538-a03d-44b1-a0f2-b7ef32b713a7",
  "title": "CRM Consultant"
}
```
