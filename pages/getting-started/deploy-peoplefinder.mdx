# Deploy the PeopleFinder sample to Netlify

Bring up the [peoplefinder sample application repo](https://github.com/aserto-demo/peoplefinder) on GitHub, and scroll down to the Deployment section, which has a “Deploy to Netlify” button. Click this button to initiate the deployment to your Netlify account (if you don’t have one, you’ll be prompted to create one - it’s free and awesome!)

You should see a screen like the following, which asks you to connect to your GitHub:

![netlify](/netlify.png)

Once you complete the OAuth2 flow and authorize Netlify, you’ll be able to configure your PeopleFinder Netlify site by copying the values from the PeopleFinder policy configuration screen:

[<img src="/netlify-form.png" width="400"/>](/netlify-form.png)

Replace the values for “Auth0 domain” and “Auth0 Client ID” with your Auth0 Single-Page Application information. 

> **Important note:** make sure this is the SPA Client ID, not the Client ID for the Machine-to-Machine application we used in the first section.  Also, if you somehow used a value other than `https://express.sample` for your Auth0 API audience, make sure to match up the values in this form.

The last two pieces of information are your Aserto tenant ID and API key.

## Getting the Tenant ID and Authorizer API key for your tenant

In the Aserto [console](https://console.aserto.com), click the “Policies” tab, and click the `peoplefinder` Policy that you created in the first section. You’ll see the Policy configuration information for the peoplefinder policy.

Copy Tenant ID, Authorizer API key, and Policy ID values and paste them into the Netlify form.

Netlify is now hard at work cloning the PeopleFinder sample repo into your GitHub account, and deploying a new site to your Netlify account, setting up a CI/CD experience for that site. 

## Testing the PeopleFinder application

When Netlify is done deploying your site, click on the deployed PeopleFinder URL to show the app hosted at `peoplefinder-xyz123.netlify.app.`  

![peoplefinder](/peoplefinder.png)

Click on the Login button and sign in with one of the users that are configured in your Auth0 account. If you didn't change the password when setting up the users, the password is `V@rySecr#et321!`.

The next few screens assume that you’ve seeded your Auth0 tenant with the sample users that we’ve set up for the PeopleFinder application.  These users have extended attributes, like `manager `and `department` which the PeopleFinder application relies on, and are used in the authorization policy.

Clicking on any of the users will show their information. Note that users can click the “Edit” button and edit their own information (like Name and Email), but can’t update other user’s information. If you click on Karen, try to change her name, and Save, you’ll get an error.

Error for editing another user’s information looks like this. Note that if you log in as a user and try to change your own information, you’ll be able to do it.

![peoplefinder put error](/peoplefinder-put-error.png)

Also note that the “Update” button is disabled for users. This behavior is entirely defined and enforced by the authorization policy, which we will look at next.

## Next steps

Next, we'll make a change in the policy that will enable managers to update the titles of their reports.
