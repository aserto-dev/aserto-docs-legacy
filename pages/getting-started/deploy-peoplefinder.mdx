# Deploy the PeopleFinder sample to Netlify

Bring up the [peoplefinder sample application repo](https://github.com/aserto-demo/peoplefinder) on GitHub, and scroll down to the Deployment section, which has a “Deploy to Netlify” button. Click this button to initiate the deployment to your Netlify account (if you don’t have one, you’ll be prompted to create one - it’s free and awesome!)

You should see a screen like the following, which asks you to connect to your GitHub:

Once you complete the OAuth2 flow and authorize Netlify, you’ll be able to configure your PeopleFinder Netlify site by copying the values from the PeopleFinder policy configuration screen:

Replace the values for “Auth0 domain” and “Auth0 Client ID” with your Auth0 Single-Page Application information. 

> **Important note:** make sure this is the SPA Client ID, not the Client ID for the Machine-to-Machine application we used in the first section.  Also, if you somehow used a value other than `https://express.sample` for your Auth0 API audience, make sure to match up the values in this form.

The last two pieces of information are your Aserto tenant ID and Authorizer API key.

## Getting the Tenant ID and Authorizer API key for your tenant

In the Aserto [console](https://console.aserto.com), click the “Policies” tab, and click the `peoplefinder` Policy that you created in the first section. You’ll see the Policy configuration information for the peoplefinder policy.

Copy Tenant ID, Authorizer API key, and Policy ID values and paste them into the Netlify form.

Netlify is now hard at work cloning the PeopleFinder sample repo into your GitHub account, and deploying a new site to your Netlify account, setting up a CI/CD experience for that site. 

## Testing the PeopleFinder application

When Netlify is done deploying your site, click on the deployed PeopleFinder URL to show the app hosted at a custom URL in the `*.netlify.app` domain.

## Next steps

Next, we'll explore the peoplefinder app and see how the authorization policy controls its behavior.
