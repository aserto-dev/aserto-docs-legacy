# PeopleFinder Quickstart

## Introduction

This guide will take you through the process of creating your first policy and using it from a 
demo application called [PeopleFinder](https://github.com/aserto-demo/peoplefinder).

At the end of the process, you will have the following:
*   A free Aserto account
*   A free tenant associated with the account
*   A connection to your Source Code Control provider (in our examples, GitHub), so Aserto can help you create Policy bundles from policies stored in a policy repository
*   A connection to your Identity Provider (in our examples, Auth0), so that Aserto can sync your users into its directory
*   An Authorizer API key, which allows your application to talk to the Aserto hosted authorizer 
*   Our sample application, [PeopleFinder](github.com/aserto-demo/peoplefinder), cloned to your GitHub account
*   Your own copy of the policy repository associated with that sample application, [policy-peoplefinder](github.com/aserto-dev/policy-peoplefinder), in your GitHub account
*   A live version of PeopleFinder deployed to your Netlify account, which uses authorization policy that comes directly from your policy-peoplefinder policy repo
*   The Aserto CLI that allows you to manage the Aserto tenant and your local developer experience
*   A local developer experience (OneBox), which allows you to run a local copy of the authorizer in a docker container

Please allow about 30 minutes to have it all working end-to-end.
