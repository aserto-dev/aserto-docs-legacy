# Installing a local authorizer running as a docker container

So far, we've only interacted with a multi-tenant hosted version of the Aserto Authorizer. But there are 
other deployment models:
* Developing locally against an "all-in-one" version of the Aserto Authorizer, referred to as the **OneBox**
* Deploying the Aserto Authorizer as a sidecar in the same kubernetes pod as the calling service
* Deploying the Aserto Authorizer as another microservice in the same subnet as the other microservices in your application

These scenarios all use the open-source `aserto-one` docker image, which is a containerized version of the 
Aserto authorization system, which can either be run independently with no connection to the Aserto control 
plane, or can be connected to the Aserto control plane to automatically receive policy changes, user attribute 
changes, and push decision logs back to the control plane.

To get started with the OneBox, you can pull it down using the Aserto CLI.

If you haven't yet, you can install it using `brew` on Mac or Linux. 

```bash
brew tap aserto-dev/tap && brew install aserto
```

Login to your Aserto account:
```bash
aserto auth login
```

You can use the CLI to install and run a local authorizer on your desktop.

The following command will pull down the latest `aserto-one` docker image.

```bash
aserto dev install  
```

The next command will pull down the configuration for a policy that you've set up in the console, using 
the name you gave it (in our case, `peoplefinder`).

```bash
aserto dev configure --name peoplefinder 
```

The following command will `docker run` a local container with the `peoplefinder` policy configuration:

```bash
aserto dev start --name peoplefinder 
```

You can use the next command to open a browser window that shows a local version of the console, to 
see what policies and users the local authorizer has. It also has a Rego playground and an API explorer 
that allow you to experiment with the Aserto authorization system.

```bash
aserto dev console  # will show you what the local authorizer is running
```

The next few commands help manage the `aserto-one` docker instance and image.

```bash
aserto dev status   # displays the running status of the authorizer
aserto dev stop     # stops the authorizer
aserto dev update   # updates the authorizer image to :latest
```

## Next Steps

Explore how the PeopleFinder sample uses the Aserto express SDK and React SDK to inject authorization into the application’s API, and conditionally render UI elements based on the “visible” and “enabled” attributes of the policy.
