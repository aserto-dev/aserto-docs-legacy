# Make a policy change

Now that we have PeopleFinder up and running against our policy, we'll make a policy change 
and see it reflected in PeopleFinder.

To start, note that for any user that is not in the "Operations" department, the "Update" button is visible, but disabled. 
This includes the hero of our story, Euan.

## Policy conventions

The Aserto console shows the current loaded policy for the hosted Authorizer instance for your tenant. If 
you click the `peoplefinder` policy in the Policies tab, you will see the current set of policy modules. 

The PeopleFinder policy follows the Aserto convention of a single policy module for each { method, route } 
of the API.  So PeopleFinder defines a policy for `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/users`, and so on.

The modules are named using the Rego `package` directive, and follow the convention `policyroot.METHOD.route`.

Let's look at the `peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id` module. In this case,
* `policyroot` is `peoplefinder` 
* `METHOD` is `POST` (signifying an HTTP POST method)
* `route` is `api.users.__id` (signifying the /api/users/:id route, with periods instead of slashes for a delimiter, following the Rego EBNF rules)

Click the `peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id` policy file. This package controls access to the “Update” button at the bottom of a User card, 
and defines the policy that authorizes users to make changes to `department` and `title` attributes.

![peoplefinder post](/peoplefinder-post.png)

> Note: don't confuse the this with the `peoplefinder.POST.api.users` policy, which controls the ability to add new users.

```rego
package peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id

default allowed = false
default visible = true
default enabled = false

allowed {
	props = input.user.attributes.properties
	props.department == "Operations"
}

enabled {
    allowed
}
```

This policy exports three values - `allowed`, `visible`, and `enabled`. `allowed` is the decision that 
governs whether an operation is allowed at the API. `visible` and `enabled` are used by the React app to 
determine how to render the UI element associated with this operation (in this case, the `Update` button).

The policy only allows the Update (POST) operation if the logged-in user has a `department` attribute that is 
equal to `Operations` - meaning, only users in the IT operations group can change titles or departments for other users.

The Update button is visible to anyone, but only enabled for users who are allowed to perform the operation.

## Making a local clone of the policy repository

In the Policy settings tab, click on the `https://github.com/[user]/policy-peoplefinder]` link which opens a new browser window. 

![peoplefinder policy clone](/peoplefinder-policy-clone.png)

Copy the clone URL, open a terminal window, and do a `git clone` on the URL. Open a code editor window in that repository directory. You’ll see all the modules for the PeopleFinder policy.

The policy modules are organized by HTTP method and path. E.g. the `post.rego` file in the `src/policies/__id directory` has a package named `peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id.`

## Policy Change

Let’s make a change that will allow managers to update the `department` and `title` of their employees.

As we mentioned, the policy defined above only allows users in the “Operations” department to Update the extended user attributes, and only enables the button if the action is allowed.

If you change the line defining the `enabled `decision to default to `true `instead of `false`, the Update button will be enabled for all users.

```rego
default enabled = true
```

If you then **add** the following `allowed` clause to the file (after the first **allowed** clause), 
the policy will allow the operation if the logged-in user is the manager of the user they are trying to Update.

```rego
allowed {
   dir.is_manager_of(input.user.id, input.resource.id)
}
```

> Note: the `dir.is_manager_of` function is part of a set of built-in Rego functions that Aserto provides.

The final state of the Rego file should look like the code listing below:

```rego
package peoplefinder.POST.api.users.__id

default allowed = false
default visible = true
default enabled = true

allowed {
	props = input.user.attributes.properties
	props.department == "Operations"
}

allowed {
   dir.is_manager_of(input.user.id, input.resource.id)
}

enabled {
    allowed
}
```

So now the Update operation is allowed if the logged in user is in the Operations department, OR if the 
logged in user is the manager of the employee that they are trying to update.

Now commit the changes, and create and push a new tag, so that the Aserto CI/CD workflow for policy changes kicks in, creates a new policy bundle based on the new tag, and makes it available to the authorizer:

```bash
git commit -am 'allow managers to update their employees'
git push 
git tag v0.0.1    # or whatever is the next tag number 
git push --tags
```

Check back to the console and ensure that the new policy is reflected in the Policy browser.

When you see the new policy has been loaded by the authorizer, go back to PeopleFinder, and switch context to April Stewart from the top-right user context menu. This 
will simulate a logout of Euan and a login of his manager, April.  Now the Update button is enabled, and April (as Euan's manager) should be able to update Euan's title.

![april can update euan](/april-can-update-euan.png)

If you change cards (for example, to April's own card), and try to update her title or department, you'll 
see the error caused by the policy denying the operation, since April is not her own manager. 

## Recap

We were able to change the authorization policy of the application without changing the application code, and without redeploying the application itself!

## Next steps

Next, we'll learn how to install the Onebox for local development.
