# Create an Auth0 SPA and API for PeopleFinder

PeopleFinder is a React single-page application (SPA) that uses Auth0 as its identity provider.

We need to create an Auth0 SPA application for PeopleFinder to bind to.

> Note: this is a different application type than the M2M application we created when we connected Aserto to Auth0.

## Create an Auth0 SPA

Create an Auth0 Single-Page Application called `PeopleFinder`, if you don’t have a SPA set up already that you would like to reuse.

Here is an example of what the Single Page Application needs to look like in the Auth0 management console:

[<img src="/auth0-spa.png" width="500px" />](/auth0-spa.png)

> Note that the Application Type must be “Single Page Application” and all the URLs (callback URLs, logout URLs, Web Origins, and Origins should be set to 
`http://localhost:3000, https://*.netlify.app` (to cover both local development and the Netlify deployment).

## Create an Auth0 API

Create a new API with an Audience name of `express.sample`.

![Auth0 API](/auth0-api.png)

Note: in the Auth0 UI, this will be labeled as “Identifier”.

![Auth0 API identifier](/auth0-api-identifier.png)

Congratulations! You now have everything you need for the Authentication portion of the PeopleFinder application.
