# Authorization

The Authorizer makes three APIs available to the calling application for the purpose of 
authorization:
* [`authz/is`](/authorizer/is)
* [`authz/query`](/authorizer/query)
* [`authz/decisiontree`](/authorizer/decisiontree)

Each of these APIs is a `POST` style API and accepts an input payload.

## Identity context

Each of the `authz` APIs accepts an [Identity context](/authorizer/identity-context) as part of 
its input payload.

## Policy context

The `is` and `decisiontree` APIs accept a [Policy context](/authorizer/policy-context) as part of 
their input payload.
