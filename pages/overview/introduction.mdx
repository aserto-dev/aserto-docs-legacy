# Introduction

Aserto is a cloud-native authorization platform that allows developers to get out of the business of 
rolling out custom access control solutions, and instead focus on their core user experience.  

## Architecture

Aserto has two major components:
* Authorizer: where authorization decisions are made
* Control Plane: manages all the artifacts that Aserto uses to make authorization decisions

## Authorizer

The [Authorizer](/overview/authorizer) is an open source authorization engine which uses the 
Open Policy Agent (OPA) to compute a **decision** based on a **policy**, **user context**, and **data**. 
It is most commonly deployed close to your application, to offer the lowest latency and the 
highest level of availability to your application.

## Control Plane

The Aserto [Control Plane](/overview/control-plane) manages the lifecycle of **policies**, 
**user context**, and **data** that are used by the authorizer. The control plane makes it easy to 
manage these artifacts centrally, and takes care of the details of synchronizing them to the 
Authorizer instance(s) deployed at the edge.

The control plane also aggregates all of the outputs from the Authorizers, including decision logs, 
to give an administrator a centralized, single-system view of a complex distributed system.
