# Aserto Directory

The Aserto Directory collects user information from identity providers that the user has 
[connected](/overview/connections) to the control plane, and makes that user information available 
to Authorizer instances. 

## Tenant Directory

Each tenant has an isolated directory that is scoped to that tenant. The tenant directory is shared 
across policies.

## Authorizer Directory

Each Authorizer instance has its own copy of the tenant directory, known as the Edge Directory Service (EDS). 
Authorizers use the EDS for real-time access to user attributes, roles, and scopes, that can be specified 
in policies to help make authorization decisions.

Aserto transparently synchronizes changes from the source identity providers (e.g. Auth0) to the tenant 
directory, and from the tenant directory to each of the Edge Directory Services that live with the 
Authorizers.

## User Context

Policies can reference [user context](/overview/policy#user-context). A calling application can 
provide the [identity context](/authorizer/identity-context) which is used to load that user context.
