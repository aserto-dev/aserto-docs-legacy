# Connections

The Aserto Control Plane manages connections to external systems that are the source of 
Aserto artifacts.

## System and User connections

There are two types of connections: system connections and user connections. 

A system connection stores the connection between the tenant and other Aserto services, such as the policy registry and 
the hosted authorizer. 

A user connection is one that the user has established between Aserto and one of their services. There 
are two types of user connections currently supported: 
* **IDP** (identity provider): this is a read-only connection between Aserto and an Identity Provider. Currently, only Auth0 is supported.
* **SCC** (source code control): this is a connection between Aserto and a source code control system. Currently, only GitHub is supported.

## Providers

A connection is an instance of a provider. Aserto supports a few providers, and this is a 
key extensibility point for the architecture. 

### Provider kinds

Aserto supports a few kinds of providers:
* IDP: identity providers
* SCC: source code control systems
* POLICY_REGISTRY: a policy registry provider
* AUTHORIZER: an authorizer provider

Every provider is an instance of a provider kind, and has expected semantics based on that provider kind. 
For example, a SCC provider must support enumerating organizations, repositories, and cloning a 
new repository based on an existing template repository.

## Creating connections

Connections are created using the Aserto [Console](/console/connections). Currently, a tenant 
member can connect a source code control system (e.g. GitHub) as the source of Policy repositories, 
and an identity provider (e.g. Auth0) as the source of users and user attributes that are managed 
by the Aserto [directory](/overview/directory).
