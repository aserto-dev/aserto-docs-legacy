# Control Plane

The Aserto Control Plane manages the lifecycle of *policies*, *user context*, and *data* that are 
used by the authorizer. The control plane makes it easy to manage these artifacts centrally, and 
takes care of the details of synchronizing them to the Authorizer instance(s) deployed at the edge.

## Concepts

The main concepts of the Aserto Control Plane are:
* [Tenant](/overivew/tenant): the organizational unit for Aserto
* [Connections](/overview/connections): connections to external systems such as identity providers and source code control systems
* [Policies](/overview/policy-lifecycle): references to a set of authorization policy repositories
* [User directory](/overview/directory): the meta-directory that Aserto builds from the identity providers that it is connected to
* [Decision logs](overview/decision-logs): a centralized log of the aggregated decisions that are made by authorizers
