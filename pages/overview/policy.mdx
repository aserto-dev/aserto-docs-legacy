# Authorization Policy

An authorization policy (or simply, a **policy**) is expressed in a declarative language called 
[rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/).

A policy can include one or more `rego` files, and one or more JSON data files.

A `rego` file has a `package` directive which sets the namespace for the rego file, and defines one or more decisions.

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

allowed {
  true
}
```

In the rego file above, the `package` name follows the Aserto convention: 
> `policy-root`.`HTTP method`.`HTTP route`

## Decision

A *decision* is an output from the evaluation of a *policy*.  The policy above exports a 
decision called `allowed`, and sets its value to `true`. 

The policy below exports the same decision (`allowed`), has a default value of `false` for this 
decision, and a rule that sets `allowed` to true only if the logged-in users's `department` attribute 
is equal to `"Sales"`: 

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders

default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.attributes.department == "Sales"
}
```

## User context

In the policy above, we were able to use the `department` attribute to help compute the `allowed` 
decision. This is an example of User context that is used in a policy.  If you hook up your 
identity providers and/or directories to Aserto, it will automatically synchronize properties from 
these sources and make them available to your policies.

In addition, you can create and manage extensions for users in the Aserto directory, on a global or 
per-application basis.
