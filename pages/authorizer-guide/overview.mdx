# Overview

The Authorizer is an open source authorization engine which uses the 
[Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org) (OPA) to 
compute a [**decision**](/overview/policy#decision) based on a [**policy**](/overview/policy), 
[**user context**](/overview/policy#user-context), and **data**.

An application can interact with the Authorizer through a set of gRPC or HTTPS REST APIs.

## Hosted Authorizer vs Edge Authorizer

Creating an Aserto tenant automatically creates a corresponding Authorizer instance in the 
multi-tenant hosted Authorizer. Since it's a multi-tenant service, the hosted Authorizer 
requires authorization headers to disambiguate the tenant and provide the tenant secret (API key). 

The Aserto authorizer can also be deployed as a sidecar (or as a local service), right next to 
your application. Since this Authorizer is a single-tenant service, it does not require authentication, 
besides the certificate validation mandated by HTTPS mutual TLS.

## Authorization

Any API call to the hosted Authorizer requires two HTTP headers:
* `Aserto-Tenant-ID: <Tenant-ID>`
* `Authorization: basic <Authorizer-API-Key>`

You can find these values in the [Policy settings](/aserto-console/view-policies#viewing-policy-settings)
in the Aserto Console.

## Authorizer API categories

The Authorizer provides the following APIs to calling applications: 
* [Authorization](/authorizer-guide/authz) (`authz`)
* [Directory](/authorizer-guide/dir) (`dir`)
* Information (`info`)
* [Policy](/authorizer-guide/policy) (`policy`)
* System (`sys`)
