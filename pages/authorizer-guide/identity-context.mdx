# Identity Context

When an Authorizer evaluates a policy, it receives an Identity Context from the calling application. 
The `mode` property of that Identity Context instructs the Authorizer how to identify the user:
* ANONYMOUS: the policy is evaluated without a user context
* MANUAL: the user context is provided as part of the request

## Passing a user identity 

In the MANUAL case, the Authorizer will look up the `identity` string in its 
local directory clone (known as the Edge Directory Service, or EDS). It will then load the user 
context and make it available to the Policy as `input.user`. 

For a user-facing API (for example, a back-end REST API that requires a JSON Web Token (JWT) 
in the `Authorization` header), the caller will often extract the `sub` claim from the JWT and use it 
in the `identity` field. That said, the `identity` can be any key that is used by the Identity Provider 
to identify the user.

## Setting the Identity Context

The `is`, `query`, and `decisiontree` API calls all take an `identityContext` map:

`POST .../api/v1/authz/is`
```json
{
  "identityContext": {
    "identity": "[aserto-user-guid]",
    "mode": "MANUAL"
  }, ...
}
```

To access the properties of the user in a policy, you can use `input.user`:

```rego
package sample.GET.api.orders
default allowed = false

allowed {
  input.user.attributes.properties.department == "Sales"
}
```
